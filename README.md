This is PowerShell code that can be used to join a computer to a domain. This was created because a company I worked at had MANY servers and had never used a domain to manage then, they were all just in a workgroup. This script was used to quickly add the servers to the domain and reduce the time to do so as well as errors. To use this file copy the code into your notepad app, edit the example path to fit yours and save as a powershell file.
